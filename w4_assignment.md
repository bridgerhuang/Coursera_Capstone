# The Battle of Neighborhoods Report

## Introduction Problem

someone is looking to open a coffee shop, as with any business decision, it requires serious consideration. Opening a new coffee shop is a lot more complicated than it seems. However, considering the location of the shop, we can simply determine whether the shop will be a success or a failure, since the location is the most important factor in this business.

The aim of this project is to find an optimal neighborhood for opening a coffee shop in Seattle, WA.

## Data

To solve this problem, the Foursquare API will be used. To explore neighborhoods in Seattle, I'll use the explore function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood.

The data will be used to compare the density of venues and coffee shops. Finally, we will find the best location with the smallest number of competitors.
